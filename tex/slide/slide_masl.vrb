\frametitle{Reconstruction (3)}
		Finally the reconstruction algorithm is used to obtain the whole waweform.

		\begin{lstlisting}
noise = detection.reconstruction(dataset_array, segments, lab,
centr, slide_len, segment_len)
		\end{lstlisting}
		The noise obtained as output is ploted along with the original and the reconstructed waweform.
